# Organizational Registration System Implementation

## Overview
The system has been successfully converted from individual user registration to **organizational/company registration**. Now when someone registers, they are registering their entire organization, not just an individual account.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Backend Model Updates

#### User Model (`authentication/models.py`)
- Added `organization` field linking users to their company
- Users are now part of an organization, not standalone

#### Company Model (`organization/models.py`)
- Removed singleton pattern - now supports multiple organizations
- Updated `get_user_company()` method to use user's organization
- Each organization is completely isolated from others

#### Employee Model (`employees/models.py`)
- Added `organization` field to link employees to their company
- Updated unique constraints to be organization-scoped

#### Department Model (`employees/models.py`)
- Added `organization` field
- Departments are now organization-specific

#### Campaign Model (`campaigns/models.py`)
- Added `organization` field
- Campaigns belong to specific organizations

#### Template Model (`templates/models.py`)
- Added `organization` field
- Templates are organization-scoped

### 2. Registration Process Updates

#### Backend Registration (`authentication/serializers.py`)
- Added company information fields to registration
- Registration now creates both user and organization
- First user automatically becomes organization admin
- User is linked to their organization during registration

#### Frontend Registration (`src/pages/signup.tsx`)
- Updated form to include organization information:
  - Company/Organization Name (required)
  - Company Domain (optional)
  - Industry selection
  - Employee count selection
- Changed UI text to reflect organizational registration
- Form validation includes company name requirement

#### AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Updated `RegisterData` interface to include company fields
- Registration API call includes organization data

### 3. Data Isolation

#### Organization-Based Access
- All API endpoints now filter data by user's organization
- Users can only see data belonging to their organization
- Complete data isolation between different organizations

#### Security Improvements
- Fixed the original issue where `pou@lol.com` could see `speed@lol.com`'s data
- Each organization has its own separate data space
- Proper multi-tenancy implementation

### 4. Migration & Data Updates
- Created migration scripts to link existing users to organizations
- Existing data properly associated with correct organizations
- All database relationships updated to support organization structure

## How It Works Now

### Registration Flow
1. User visits signup page
2. Fills out personal information AND organization information
3. System creates:
   - User account (automatically set as admin role)
   - Organization/company record
   - Links user to their organization
4. User is redirected to dashboard with organization admin privileges

### Data Access
- Users only see data belonging to their organization
- Organization settings are shared among organization members
- Each organization has isolated:
  - Employee lists
  - Campaign data
  - Template libraries
  - Department structures
  - Company settings

### User Roles
- First person who registers becomes organization admin
- Additional users can be added to the organization later
- All organization data is shared among organization members

## Benefits

1. **True Multi-Tenancy**: Complete data isolation between organizations
2. **Security**: No data leakage between different companies
3. **Scalability**: Support for unlimited organizations
4. **Collaboration**: Organization members share resources
5. **Administration**: Clear organization admin structure

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
- All major entities now have `organization` foreign key
- Unique constraints updated to be organization-scoped
- Proper CASCADE relationships for data integrity

### API Endpoints
- All endpoints filter by user's organization
- Organization-scoped data retrieval
- Proper authentication and authorization

### Frontend
- Registration form includes organization setup
- Navigation includes logout functionality
- Settings page shows organization information

The system is now ready for production use with proper organizational registration and complete data isolation between different companies/organizations.
